  whiskey_disk:
  - look at git-deploy for some useful hooks
  - allow for running anything locally (including refreshing configs) as opposed to always remotely
  - pulling origin master probably isn't sufficient, need to be more sophisticated
  - un-spike
  - README to show how it works
  - get a working key for ogc deployments for fapestniegd/websages, push our configs there
