Running Tests
=============

The test suite is written using [bacon][bacon] and [mocha][mocha].  As such, you need to have the mocha and bacon gems installed on your system to run the test suite, as well as the [mocha-on-bacon][mb] driver gem.  You should then be able to just run `rake` from your whiskey\_disk checkout and see it run the spec.

To run the integration spec suite, see the `README.integration_specs` file.
